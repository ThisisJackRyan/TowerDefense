## About
This repository contains a simple Java application designed to illustrate the structure of a command-line program that utilizes a menu system for initial user interaction. The `Main` class serves as the entry point, initiating the application flow by calling an introductory method from a `Menu` class.

## Features
*   **Menu System**: Implements a basic menu structure (`Menu.intro()`) to handle the initial program flow and user introduction.
*   **Simple Entry Point**: A clear `main` method in `Main.java` demonstrates how to start a standard Java application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To compile and run this application, you will need:
*   Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system (version 8 or higher recommended).

### Installation
1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-username/your-repo-name.git` with the actual repository URL and name if applicable, or ensure all `.java` files are in the same directory.)*

## Usage
To compile and run the application from your terminal:

1.  Navigate to the directory containing the `Main.java` (and `Menu.java`) files.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/java-menu-application
    ```

2.  Compile the Java source files:
    ```bash
    javac Main.java Menu.java
    ```
    *(This command assumes a `Menu.java` file exists in the same directory, defining the `Menu` class.)*

3.  Run the compiled application:
    ```bash
    java Main
    ```
    This will execute the `main` method in `Main.java`, which in turn calls `Menu.intro()`, thereby starting the application's menu interface.
